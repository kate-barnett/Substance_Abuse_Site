 <p id="why">The graph above shows the relationship between Heroin related ER visits and Heroin related treatment admissions. It shows that both ER visits and Treatment Admissions are increasing, but ER visits are increasing at a much larger rate. The red flag is how fast ER visits are increasing, and the lack of increase of treatment admissions. This graph shows the need for their to be more treatment admissions, since treatment facilities are often better suited for helping the individual. Heroin was found to be the most appealing drug due to rise in opioid usage in Kentucky and the OCDP calls it the "cheapest drug". The issue with the graph above is the seperation between ER visits and admission to treatment is so large. This why there needs to be <strong>a direct referal to treatment prior to discharge from the emergency room</strong>. This would allow for their to be an immediate opportunity for the individual to get the help they need. Individuals are at their most vulnerable time once they are starting their detox, by having a space where they can have support throughout the process is very important. Policies today reflect individuals political beliefs instead of being based on  the facts. Individuals are hesistant to make these changes due to their own implicit biases. Dispite the stigma that people struggling with addiction still face from some health professionals and the community at large, those experiecning overdoses are motivated to pursue recovery especially when there is support initiated at the point of care from the emergency department. In fact, a 2017 study done by scholars at Yale University found that more than half of the patients referred to treatment directly from the ED, including medication assisted therapy, remained actice in their full recovery for atleast 6 months. This population can often be forgotten, but do deserve support from their community. As was shown in my dashboard overdose fatality is rising and we need to help stop it, by having more treatment beds open, with the support of hospitals doing direct referals there could be hope that the rate of deaths would decrease.
