    <p id=resource1>I trust this source becauses it is data from The 
    kentucky Office of Drug Control. This data is realeased by The Commonwealth of Kentucky. It releases data every year on issues that relate to Drug Control Policy. Using info from their data set I was able to complie the number of opioid related deaths, by age group, in 2019. Being able to look at how every age group if hit by larger numbers of death highlights how big of a problem substance abuse is. I think this data gives Kentucky a wake up call thta we need to do more and support this community that is often forgotten.</p>

  <p id=resource2> I trust this source because it was released by SAMHSA, The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. This organization works to help showcase data that can help lead to more solutions down the road. Their data helped me show that substance abuse is a common struggle for so many different age groups. This data showcases that there need to be more resources, like more treatment programs, and communities that can help these individuals on their journey to recovery.

    <p id=resource3> This data was also obtained from The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. I trust that their material is legitimate because of the high reputation they have. This certain dataset helped to show that those who we expect to use, are often not the ones who are hurting the most. This set also looked at the relationship between those who used marijuana and the likely hood they would transition to harder drugs. I know this is often a subject that people do not address. The truth is that often once someone tries a new drug they will want to try again and thi is especially true if someone is already addiction to another substance. This data helps me realize that their needs to be more opportunities for individuals to have safe spaces, and groups, like AA, that they can go to and get help at the beginning of their addiction. Having a support network in the beginning can help change that individuals path.

    Link to Data on Substance Abuse in 12-17 Year Olds</a>
   
    <p id=resource4> This data was also found through The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which again is a very trustworthy organization. This data split up what substances were most used for children ages 12-17. I was devastated to see that cocaine was one of the highest substances used by this age group. Cocaine is such a heavy drug that can cause so much suffering and pain. Hearing that this was the "popular" drug made me realize that kids do not understand the severity of drugs, and that adults do not understand how serious the drugs being used by these children are. There needs to be better education and support systems in place so that these children do not end up addicted at such a young age.</p>
