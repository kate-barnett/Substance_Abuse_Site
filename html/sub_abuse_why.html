    <p id=introp> I have had the honor of working with mothers who are navigating their recovery for the past 5 years. My mother founded a non-profit called ChooseWell Communites that helps families navigating recovery with finding housing, finding a job or starting school, finding childcare, and classes on Friday's that help with parenting and other life style skills. Through my work with ChooseWell I have become very upset with how the system criminalizes these families who are very sick, and often have very traumatic past. I believe that sharing a more positive narrative of this often forgotten population can help show that we are all people and we all need a community that has our back! </p>
