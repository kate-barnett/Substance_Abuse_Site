<p> While doing research I noticed a common theme, this being that not one age group is specifically affected by substance abuse. It is a disease that affects some many people. I think through my data it can be determined that there needs to be a change in our whole system. It is clear throughout my research that so many individuals are hurting and in need of more reosurces. I can speak from personal experience that there needs to be more beds within treatment facilities. My mother founded a nonprofit called ChooseWell Communities. ChooseWell  works with mothers in recovery to help them with finding housing, finding a job/ education, and helping support parenting skills. One common struggle that had constantly occured was that when individuals would relapse it would be very challenging to get them in to treatment because "bed were always full". I belive that there are systematical changes that could help support this community that is constantly ignored. Which in the end would create a community that truly does work to support everyone. </p>

    <div>Figure 1</div>

    <div> Figure 1 showcases what type of substances are used by 12-17 during 2017. It is very interesting that cocaine was the highest used substance. Cocaine is a very strong drug that is very addictive, seeing that children are leaning towards heavy drugs proves that there needs to be more education and support for this community. This could be through treatment programs specifically desgined for younger children that can get to the route cause of what is going on. It can also be beneficial becuase it can help them start their road to recovery sooner rather than continue their with addiction. </div>

    <div>Figure 2</div>
        
        <div> Figure 2 was created with data from SAMHSA. It is looking at the percentage of risk for individuals who have previously used marijuana transitioning to harder drugs. The main take away from this figure is that majority of age groups are relatively close to each other percentage wise. There is only one group that is a large portion smaller, the 18-25 year olds. This is interesting when reflecting on because this is the age group that is typically associated with substance misuse. </div>

    <div>Figure 3</div>
    
    <div>Figure 3 is also data taken from SAMHSA, it showcases annual drug use by age group from 2016-2018 in Kentucky. This is where I believe it becomes very interesting. When you look at the data it is obvious there is one group that is a large amount higher in dug use. The 18-25 year olds end up being the highest users in majority of the substate regions. This is completely opposite to what has been showcased above. This is where I started realizing that there is not one group that is affected more by substance abuse. Each age group has a percentage of users. This shows a problem, if we truly are a state that cares for their community we should not constantly be rising in usage rates. This figure represents the sad truth that our community is failing at being the support system. </div>

    <div>Figure 4</div>
   
    <div>Figure 4 shows the sad truth of what can happen when individuals are dealing with addiction. Overdose is an issue that Kentucky has been dealing with for a while, but as this data shows it has been steady for the past few years. This data was compiled from The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, who is set in place to look at data associated with substance abuse and see what policy needs to be in place to help with this large issue. I believe that this figure showcases that there needs to be a change and that we cannot have those in recovery navigating their recover on their own. We need a community that can be present and listen to the needs of these individuals and support them throughout their recovery. If we truly want to be the most compassionate city or state we need to truly work together as a community to tackle this disease and support those who are affected by it.</div>
